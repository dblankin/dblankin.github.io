I have an HP laptop that I like.  It is fairly new, has an i7 chip, 1TB hard drive, 8GB ram, is sleek, slim and quick.  I do all my coding on it and have all my couses of study on it.  
Last night, lightening may have gotten it....
It will not power on at all.  I had to do an HP warranty claim and they were fantastic!  I've got a return box coming so stay tuned...

UPDATE:
Lightening did get it.  Had to buy another one.  Got an Asus with i7, 1T SSD, 16G Ram - the touchpad is also a screen.  So far, pretty nifty!.
